## Angular-cli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.1.

## Running the unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

(Un)comment various code blocks in the classes and services in the `*.spec.ts` files to run the sample tests.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project doesn't do anything slightly interesting, besides from the tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

It currently doesn't have any additional e2e-tests.
